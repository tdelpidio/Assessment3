<div class="career-goals">
    <p class="career-goals" id="past-career">After high school, I was accepted into the Veterinary Technician program at my local community college. During my first semester, I had my very first Vet Tech class and by week 2 the instructor went over office procedures for euthanizing animals. I quickly realized that my heart would never be able to handle what Veterinary Technicians have to endure. I decided to take a break from college until I figured out what I wanted to pursue. I was hired full time at a law firm shortly after leaving college and I've been stuck in that field ever since.</p> 
        
    <p class="career-goals" id="mission">Leaving my fulltime job to become a fulltime student was terrifying. I've been using that fear as motivation. Failure is not an option. I hope to specialize in web development at DevMountain. Once I graduate, I plan to continue building my portfolio and applying to every possible web developer job that I am qualified for. Eventually, I hope to work remotely as a full-time web developer.</p>
